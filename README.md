*Who is Bob? Is he "rlp" (r for Robert?) Am I right in guessing that these are libraries/utilities that you used in house?*

Bob’s Apple Graphics were developed by one of our software engineers, Robert Pyron.  This library is at the heart of nearly all of the Apple II products we developed. 

Not sure if the code was ever documented beyond what’s in the source blocks, but it might be of interest to anyone developing on the Apple II.
